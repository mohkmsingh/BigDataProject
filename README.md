# BigDataProject
In this project, we sought to answer the question: "Is it better if the skillset of a companyâ€™s founding team is similar or dissimilar from each other?" To do this, we used a [2013 Snapshot of Crunchbase's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/startup-investments) financial data and [OpenAI's Word-Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) to analyze the semantic differences between the major's of company founders. 

Please see our article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mohkm.singh/should-startup-founders-seek-diversely-skilled-co-founders-711c546c67f3) for a more in depth discussion of our methodology and findings. 

# Word Embedding Spreadsheet
If you'd like access to the spreadsheet with the word-embedded majors, here is a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvnU4BWeQmLVNWteaVGY13WIUOTXD8Ft/view?usp=sharing) link to that. We could not upload our dataset to this GitHub because the spreadsheets were too large. This was used in conjunction with the Crunchbase dataset to perform our analysis.
